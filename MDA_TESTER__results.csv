 Data showing number of available samples with no missing data (class mix and total 
 number of missing elements for chosen FV subset): 
Note: entry FV(i) denotes a subset of FV from 1-i 

Number of training samples with no missing values and its related class mix using ALL features FVi is given as the last entry in the list below

FV3 to FV1, 9, 0
FV3 to FV4, 7, 4
FV3 to FV10, 4, 9

Once the user analyses the data above he/she can explore tradeoffs between choosing feature subset 
vs. available samples (with missing or no missing data) checking at the same time that class mix satisfies 
ML needs. Then user can extract desired samples using utility ExtractSamples. More specifically:
Based on desired number of  samples related number  of feature values FVi  as well as class mix for 
available samples (which may depend on specific ML algorithm) the user can chose the best “operating 
point” e.g. subset of feature values FVi  for which to extract samples for further processing. 
User then runs ExtractSamples utility which for a given subset of feature values FVi  (user input)  
allows extraction of:
* Only samples with no missing values (option c) – number of these samples is less than original 
number of samples and is given in the data above 
* All samples (option m) in which case some will have missing values
ExtractSamples will then create news training DB in CSV format with each sample having original ID 
preserved followed by chosen subset of Feature Values FVi (with original names preserved) and 
corresponding (original) class label. Note that the order of samples and feature values will be different 
from the original database.  In case user chooses option “m” the actual missing value replacement is left 
to the user since it is highly application and data dependent.
